            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Kid Cafe Lakeland was founded by a local mom and teacher who was disappointed with the lack of safe and engaging 
               indoor play areas for her small children. She decided to create her own playground that offers a variety of 
               activities for kids 0 to 4 years old. Our small business prides itself on ensuring all races and religions feel 
               accepted in our spaces. Minority owned, Veteran Owned, and we can't wait to see everyone ðŸ˜€
